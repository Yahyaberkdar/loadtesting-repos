from the README:

The goal of the YCSB project is to develop a framework and common set
of workloads for evaluating the performance of different "key-value"
and "cloud" serving stores. The project comprises two things:

* The YCSB Client, an extensible workload generator

* The Core workloads, a set of workload scenarios to be executed by
  the generator
